# miscellaneous
Here I propose to gather useful scripts doing nontrivial tasks which other people might have a need for.

# To Do 
- fix all the `ELIA: modify 'same_lattice' to 'false'` comments
- modify `get_real` and add `y` to each datapoint, so it's faster to access the "real" value in the loss function
